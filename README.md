# Simulator for Custom Applications SDK 

This is under heavy development currently.

## Getting Started
Clone the SDK repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/flyandi/mazda-custom-application-sdk`

Then, build the SDK from the SDK directory:  
```
npm install
npm run build-install
```

To run the simulator, clone this repository after setting up the SDK and run:  
```
npm install
npm run simulator
```

Set the runtime SDK location to `<SDK_base_directory>/build/system`.
